## Lise Acheivements:

- Beating Stockfish level 1

- Drawing to Maia9 (avg rating 1900)

- Drawing to Maia5 (avg rating 1700)

- Drawing 3 times to beginner trained Maia Chess engine Maia1

- Beating random movers within 5 to 30 moves

Some of the acheivements are notable beacause Lise is using plan search alongside using its Eval function to determine the best moves.



## Discord Engine Algorithm

For Discord Lise supports two operations **/resetboard** and **/move** here Lise only plays blackside due to Discord's message nature, and algoritm runs on plan negamax move search.

- Simple Negamax move search

- Simple eval function consider space only


## Lichess Engine Algorithm

- Lichess Lise engine is intermediate type of engine (rating about 1200) that uses its own eval function and negamax and human generative blackside play.

## White Side Eval Function

- Give each legal move an identity by assigning it value for given piece it has. This value is inverse of piece value.

- Give each capture an identity by assigning it value for given piece it has plus an constant of 1 to find re-captures

- Material count for both sides and use piece Value function

- King Safety and Mating net finder


## Black Side Function

Lise uses shuffling method and uses index hashtable to randomly give each legal move an unqiue value. Along side this, Lise constaly shuffles legal moves out of order to generate an beginner's approch by playing moves what it thinks are best by assuming moves based on shuffling method.
