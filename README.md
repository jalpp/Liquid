## Lise Acheivements:

- drawing 3 times to beginner trained Maia Chess engine



## Engine Algorithm

Lise is a beginner engine, who can play two main openings
Hippo defense and King's Indian Defense(Attack). Even though Lise can
play openings well, it plays middlegames/endgames like a intermediate 
player via using negamax + openingbook + basic eval function.

**Algorithms**

LiseChessEngine uses Minimax, Negamax and Lookup table Index algo

**Opening Book**

Runs for Discord, opening book not supported for Lichess

- [Hippo Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus_Defence)
- [King's Indian Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence)

**Negamax Algorithm**
[Chessprogramming.org](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax)

- runs on depth 4, more the depth better move but slower search (not ideal for Discord)
- functions with eval function 

**Eval function**

- takes account of chess board area and all legal moves
- compares current player's piece value count to oppoenet's


**Piece Value**
The engine takes account a basic piece value 

- Bishop & Knight 3 points
- Pawn 1 point
- Rook 5 points
- Queen 9 points
- King 200 points

## Engine Upgrades

Lise is still being worked on, with intentions to add

- A full tablebase support for better endgame play
- more opening support
- support for playing white side
- support for tactics creation
- transition to NN for dynamic piece values
